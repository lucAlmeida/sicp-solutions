;; The procedure a-plus-abs-b has an operator whose value depends on whether b is positive or negative.
;; If b is positive, then the procedure returns the sum of a and b.
;; But if b is negative, then the returned value is the subtraction between a and the negative value b.
;; In this second case, the returned value is the sum of a and the absolute value of b, because the sign of b is inverted.
